# React Shopping Cart App with Redux Toolkit

This is a simple shopping cart application built using React and Redux Toolkit. The app allows users to browse products, add them to the cart, update quantities, and view their cart contents.

## Features

- Browse a list of products.
- Add products to the shopping cart.
- Update quantities of products in the cart.
- Remove products from the cart.
- Calculate and display the total price of items in the cart.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Redux Toolkit: A toolset for efficient Redux development, including state management and simplified actions.
- HTML & CSS(Tailwind): For structuring and styling the application.
- [Optional] React Router: For handling navigation between different pages/views.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-shopping-cart-repo.git
   cd your-shopping-cart-repo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The app should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `src/`
  - `components/`: Contains React components used to build the UI.
  - `slices/`: Houses Redux Toolkit slices for managing different parts of the application's state (e.g., products, cart).
  - `app/`: Configures the Redux store using Redux Toolkit.
  - `index.js`: Entry point of the application.

## Usage

- Browse the list of products on the main page.
- Click the "Add to Cart" button on a product to add it to the cart.
- Navigate to the cart page to view and modify the items in your cart.
- You can update the quantity of each item or remove it from the cart entirely.
- The total price of items in the cart will be displayed.
- [Optional] Add more features or customize the app to your liking!
